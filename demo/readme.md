# djFlixel Demo

This is an all around demonstration of the library. Incorporates most of the tools and objects.  
Currently it **supports** building into **HASHLINK** and **FLASH**.  
**HTML5** has issues with some per-pixel operations effects.  

> :cake: Native **Windows** and **Linux** builds are untested, but they might work out of the box.
