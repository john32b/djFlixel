## About

I started working on this in parallel with my video game projects. The philosophy is to be a simple to use library that can streamline some parts of your code.

Checkout the `dev` branch for latest updates. I have tried to provide examples and comments all over the code where I can.

>**Note:** Not everything is documented and some parts need refactoring and re-design, This is a continuous work and somethings might change in the future !

Feel free to open an issue/suggestion and contact me in social media and email. :smile: Donations are always welcome!
